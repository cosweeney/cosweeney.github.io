## Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

## about me

I'm a physics PhD candidate at the [University of Arizona](https://w3.physics.arizona.edu/research/astrophysics-and-cosmology) working on constraining cosmology with galaxy clusters under Eduardo Rozo. My research interests are in computational astrophysics, physical cosmology, particle physics related to dark matter, and data science.

I earned my B.S. in Astrophysics from the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I researched cosmic-ray diffusion and gamma-ray emission in Andromeda (M31) under Stefano Profumo. 

If you’d like to find out more about me and my work, check out the info on my [research](https://cosweeney.github.io/projects/), [CV](https://cosweeney.github.io/cv/), and [teaching](https://cosweeney.github.io/teaching/) pages. Also feel free to contact me via my email.

## outside of academia..

When I’m not working on research, I’m most likely spending my time exploring Tucson, playing rugby, reading, or playing with my dog, Nova.
