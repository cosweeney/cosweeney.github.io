## Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a second-year physics grad student at the [University of Arizona](https://w3.physics.arizona.edu/research/astrophysics-and-cosmology) working under Eduardo Rozo. My research interests are largely in (computational) astrophysics, cosmology, and high-energy physics related to the nature of Dark Matter.

I earned my B.S. in Astrophysics from the University of California, Santa Cruz (go slugs!), where I was involved in research on cosmic-ray diffusion and gamma-ray emission in Andromeda (M31) under Stefano Profumo.
